The Maltese Domestic Dataset (MDD) is an open-source collection of annotated images of domestic waste bags captured in Maltese streets. This dataset is designed to support the development of machine learning models, particularly custom object detectors, by providing high-quality labeled data for categorizing various types of waste bags. The MDD is instrumental in addressing waste management challenges by enabling automated waste classification systems.

## Categories
The waste bags in this dataset have been categorized as follows:

1. Mixed  Waste (Black Bags) - Waste bags containing general refuse.

2. Organic Waste (White Bags) - Waste bags used for organic material such as food scraps and garden waste.

3. Recyclable Material (Grey Bags) -  Waste bags designated for recyclable materials like paper, plastic, and metal.

4. Other Waste - This category includes any waste bags not falling into the above categories. 

## Clone the repository:
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AFLucas-UOM/ARI3129-MDD.git

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of the `ARI3129` course at the `University of Malta`.
